    "- 'generator': For single-file tasks, specific functions, bug fixes, or refactoring.\n"
    "- 'planner': For multi-file architectures, complex systems, or vague requirements.\n"
    "- 'other': If the request is not about coding.\n\n"
    "### 2. TESTING DECISION ('run_tests')\n"
    "Determine if a separate TEST SUITE execution is strictly necessary.\n"
    "- **FALSE**: If the task is simple logic, math (e.g., '2+2', 'factorial'), standard algorithms, basic string manipulation, or pure documentation.\n"
    "  -> EVEN IF IT IS LOGICAL, if it is simple/standard, set FALSE unless the user asked to verify it.\n"
    "- **TRUE**: Only for complex custom business logic, unknown edge cases, or risky algorithms.\n\n"
